- The old solution used BFS which is just complex for a problem like this


- The diameter and depth of a binary tree are important concepts in tree data structures. Let's define each of them:

### Diameter of a Binary Tree

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. This path may or may not pass through the root. The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

For example, in the binary tree below:

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5
```

The diameter is 3, corresponding to the path [4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3] or [5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3].

### Depth (Height) of a Binary Tree

The depth (or height) of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf node. The depth is the number of edges in the longest path from the root node to a leaf node.

In the same example tree:

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5
```

The depth is 2, corresponding to the path [1 -> 2 -> 4] or [1 -> 2 -> 5].

### Calculating Diameter and Depth

To calculate these values, you can use recursive functions. Here is how you might do it in Python:

#### Calculating the Diameter

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        self.ans = 0

        def depth(node: TreeNode) -> int:
            if not node:
                return 0
            left_depth = depth(node.left)
            right_depth = depth(node.right)
            self.ans = max(self.ans, left_depth + right_depth)
            return 1 + max(left_depth, right_depth)

        depth(root)
        return self.ans

# Example usage
# Constructing the tree
#         1
#        / \
#       2   3
#      / \
#     4   5

root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
root.left.right = TreeNode(5)

sol = Solution()
print(sol.diameterOfBinaryTree(root))  # Output: 3
```

#### Calculating the Depth

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        left_depth = self.maxDepth(root.left)
        right_depth = self.maxDepth(root.right)
        return 1 + max(left_depth, right_depth)

# Example usage
# Constructing the same tree
root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
root.left.right = TreeNode(5)

sol = Solution()
print(sol.maxDepth(root))  # Output: 3
```

In these examples:

- `diameterOfBinaryTree` calculates the diameter by keeping track of the maximum value of `left_depth + right_depth` at each node.
- `maxDepth` calculates the depth by finding the maximum depth from the left and right subtrees at each node.

These concepts and methods will help you understand the structure and properties of binary trees better.
