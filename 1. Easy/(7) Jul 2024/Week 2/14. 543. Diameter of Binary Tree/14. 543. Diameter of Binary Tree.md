- Variable Scope: The answer variable needs to be nonlocal (or global) within the nested depth function so it can be modified.

- Immutable types: Variables that cannot be changed after they are created. Examples include integers, floats, strings, and tuples. If you try to modify an immutable variable inside a nested function, Python will create a new local variable unless you use nonlocal or global.

- Mutable types: Variables that can be changed after they are created. Examples include lists, dictionaries, and sets. You can modify the contents of a mutable variable inside a nested function without reassigning it.

- The `nonlocal` keyword in Python is used to indicate that a variable refers to a variable in the nearest enclosing scope that is not global. This is particularly useful when you have nested functions and you want to modify a variable that is defined in an enclosing (but non-global) scope.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

### Example Without `nonlocal`

Consider the following example without using `nonlocal`:

```python
def outer_function():
    count = 0

    def inner_function():
        count = 10  # This creates a new local variable `count` in `inner_function`
        print("Inner count:", count)

    inner_function()
    print("Outer count:", count)

outer_function()
```

Output:
```
Inner count: 10
Outer count: 0
```

In this case, the `count` variable inside `inner_function` does not modify the `count` variable in `outer_function`. Instead, it creates a new local variable `count` inside `inner_function`.

### Using `nonlocal`

Now, let's use `nonlocal` to modify the `count` variable in the enclosing scope:

```python
def outer_function():
    count = 0

    def inner_function():
        nonlocal count  # This refers to the `count` variable in `outer_function`
        count += 10
        print("Inner count:", count)

    inner_function()
    print("Outer count:", count)

outer_function()
```

Output:
```
Inner count: 10
Outer count: 10
```

Here, the `nonlocal` keyword tells Python that the `count` variable in `inner_function` refers to the `count` variable in `outer_function`. Therefore, the modification inside `inner_function` affects the `count` variable in the enclosing scope.


In summary, `nonlocal` is used to modify variables in the nearest enclosing scope that is not global, which is essential for working with nested functions when you need to update an outer function's variable.
