Topological sorting is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge \(u \rightarrow v\), vertex \(u\) comes before vertex \(v\) in the ordering. This is useful in scenarios where you need to schedule tasks based on their dependencies, like course prerequisites or build systems.

### Example

Consider the following DAG:

```
   5      4
   | \   / |
   |  \ /  |
   v   v   v
   2   0   1
    \ / \ / 
     v   v
     3   6
```

In this graph:
- Vertex 5 points to 2 and 0.
- Vertex 4 points to 0 and 1.
- Vertex 2 points to 3.
- Vertex 0 points to 3 and 6.
- Vertex 1 points to 6.

### Steps for Topological Sorting

1. **Identify vertices with no incoming edges (in-degree 0).** These are starting points because they don't depend on any other vertices.
2. **Remove these vertices and their outgoing edges from the graph.** Add these vertices to the topological order.
3. **Repeat the process** with the remaining graph until all vertices are processed.

### Performing Topological Sort on the Example Graph

1. Identify vertices with in-degree 0: {5, 4}
2. Choose any of them (say, 5) and add it to the topological order.
   - Remove 5 and its outgoing edges. Remaining graph:

```
   4
   | \
   |  \
   v   v
   2   0   1
    \ / \ / 
     v   v
     3   6
```
3. Repeat with remaining vertices with in-degree 0: {4, 2}
   - Add 4 to the topological order and remove it and its outgoing edges. Remaining graph:

```
   2   0   1
    \ / \ / 
     v   v
     3   6
```
4. Continue with the remaining vertices with in-degree 0: {2, 1}
   - Add 2, remove it and its outgoing edges. Remaining graph:

```
   0   1
    \ / 
     v
     3   6
```
5. Continue with vertices with in-degree 0: {0, 1}
   - Add 0, remove it and its outgoing edges. Remaining graph:

```
   1
    \
     v
     6
    /
   v
   3
```
6. Continue with vertices with in-degree 0: {1}
   - Add 1, remove it and its outgoing edges. Remaining graph:

```
     6
    /
   v
   3
```
7. Continue with vertices with in-degree 0: {6}
   - Add 6, remove it and its outgoing edges. Remaining graph:

```
   3
```
8. Continue with vertices with in-degree 0: {3}
   - Add 3, remove it and its outgoing edges. Remaining graph is now empty.

### Result

The topological order for this example can be one of several valid orders. One possible order is:

\[5, 4, 2, 0, 1, 6, 3\]

### Algorithm Implementation (Kahn's Algorithm)

Here is a Python implementation using Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting:

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def topological_sort_kahn(vertices, edges):
    in_degree = {v: 0 for v in vertices}
    adj_list = defaultdict(list)

    # Build the graph
    for u, v in edges:
        adj_list[u].append(v)
        in_degree[v] += 1

    # Queue for all vertices with in-degree 0
    queue = deque([v for v in vertices if in_degree[v] == 0])
    top_order = []

    while queue:
        vertex = queue.popleft()
        top_order.append(vertex)

        # Decrease the in-degree of the neighbors
        for neighbor in adj_list[vertex]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)

    # Check if there was a cycle
    if len(top_order) == len(vertices):
        return top_order
    else:
        return "There exists a cycle in the graph"

# Example usage
vertices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
edges = [(5, 2), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (2, 3), (0, 3), (0, 6), (1, 6)]
print(topological_sort_kahn(vertices, edges))
```

This will output one of the valid topological orders, such as:

\[5, 4, 2, 0, 1, 3, 6\]
